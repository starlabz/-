							The latest innovation as thought by our developers to support the imagination of the small kids is the the very own comic books famous ..... THE TIIME MACHINE.
						</p>

						<p>Time machine by basic definition is a machine which is used as a portal to travel in time.
						we can go anywhere in the past and present and last but not least to the future and predict it.....!!!!
						Think you can be almost equivalent to a mini god and predict what is to come and save many peoples lives and prevent from disasters happening in the lives of people.
						we can do what we like and correct our mistakes and become a better person. it is working on the mechanism of a particle accelerator.
						we accelerate 2 particles at very high speed almost equal to 2 mac that is 1.5 times the speed of sound.And when they bombard with each other at such a high velocity that they create a stable wormhole something like a blackhole which is used to travel to a parallel universe.
						so the person just has to think of the place where he wants to go in his memory and he will be sent there by the machine itself.just simple and pure science with a little bit of a ficticious mind ...to inspire the children and make their dreams come true.
